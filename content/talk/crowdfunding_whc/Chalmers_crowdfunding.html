# What is crowdfunding?

???
- Research is at very early stage. Planning and background. 
- Very interested in feedback, and also if *anyone is interested in getting involved*

- Briefly: crowdfunding is now a well-known internet phenomenon,
- Anyone can create a page
-- set a donation goal -- tell a story about what the money will be used for -- share on social media
-- doners can comment on and share the pages as well -- 

- Used for all sorts of donations - including 
-- political campaigns
-- new interventions
-- research programs
-- and of course health care costs

- GoFundMe is the most popular crowdfunding page in the world
- Most of the donations on GoFundMe go towards health care costs

# Crowdfunding for healthcare costs

???

- So these GoFundMe pages have been around for 10 or so years
- More researchers are starting to investigate these pages

- Most of the research has been done in the US, where these pages are really popular. It's not surprising considering the high cost of health care and the number of uninsured people. 
- People who post GoFundMe campaigns in the US don't have to *justify* why they are seeking the funds, because everyone is so familiar with stories of medical bankruptcy.

# Why investigate crowdfunding? 


&gt; [Crowdfunding is a] "symptom and cause of, rather than a solution to, health system injustices...  It is important to address the ethical and practical effects of crowdfunding for campaigners, recipients, donors' and health systems." 


.footnote[ 
Snyder, J., et al. (2016). "Fund my treatment!: A call for ethics-focused social science research into the use of crowdfunding for medical care." Social Science &amp; Medicine 169: 27-30. 
]


???

- John Snyder has published a number of recent pieces on crowdfunding, starting with this call to action viewpoint piece in 2016. --&gt;

#Crowdfunding for healthcare costs

Figure: Word clouds for crowdfunding campaigns for prostate cancer and breast cancer.

.footnote[
Loeb, S., et al. (2018). "Crowdfunding for prostate cancer and breast cancer." BJU International 122(5): 723-725.
]


???

- So what do we know about crowdfunding so far?

- Some research in this area has had a quantitative approach: investigating conditions for particular diseases or in particular locations. 

- This is one piece from the US where they investigated breast and prostate cancer pages.

- Other recent work has also focussed on pages for organ transplantation, and orthopaedic surgery. 

- These investigations look at the 'success' rates of these campaigns, and what about these pages (such as the number of social media shares or set goal) make them more likely to raise money.

#Crowdfunding for unproven or low-value treatments

.footnote[
Vox, F., et al. (2018). "Medical Crowdfunding for Scientifically Unsupported or Potentially Dangerous Treatments." JAMA 320(16): 1705-1706.
]

???

- Some new research has asked whether these funds are going towards unproven or low-value treatments. 

- There was a piece in JAMA last year where the authors searched GoFundMe for five unsupported treatments. 

- They found 1000 campaigns, seeking $27 million in total. 

&lt;!-- --- --&gt;
&lt;!-- #Crowdfunding for unproven or low-value treatments --&gt;

&lt;!-- 220 campaigns on GoFundMe for unproven homeopathy cancer treatments --&gt;

&lt;!-- - 83 (38%) used alternative treatments as complementary to traditional treatment.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- - 69 (31%) could not pursue traditional treatment for financial or medical reasons. --&gt;

&lt;!-- - 63 (29%) chose to forgo traditional treatment because of a fear of its effects or skepticism about activity.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- ] --&gt;

&lt;!-- ??? --&gt;

&lt;!-- - A really recent study published in Lancet Oncology looked for campaigns from cancer patients that were looking to fund homeopathy. --&gt;

&lt;!-- --- --&gt;
&lt;!-- #Crowdfunding for unproven or low-value treatments --&gt;

&lt;!-- 63 (29%) campaigns made unsubstantiated, positive claims about the activity of these treatments.  --&gt;
&lt;!-- &gt; "Thus far, he's been immersed in cancer-fighting foods, supplements, herbs, etc. we believe this is why the tumour growth has slowed, and not spread" --&gt;

&lt;!-- &gt;"Homeopathic/naturopathic medicine has been proven to have outstanding healing results and a lot of patients are still able to live their lives because of it.".  --&gt;

&lt;!-- ] --&gt;

&lt;!-- ??? --&gt;

&lt;!-- - These researchers looked at how these campaigners had described the evidence of these treatments. --&gt;

&lt;!-- - Only two (1%) campaigns acknowledged the uncertain activity of these treatments. --&gt;

&lt;!-- ??? --&gt;

&lt;!-- - Claire Tanner and Megan Munsie from the University of Melbourne have been looking at stem cell treatments for quite a while,  --&gt;
&lt;!-- - really recently they've published their analysis of GoFundMe pages for unproven stem cell treatments --&gt;

&lt;!-- - most of these pages came from the United States --&gt;

&lt;!-- --- --&gt;

&lt;!-- # Crowdfunding for unproven stem cell treatments --&gt;

&lt;!-- &gt; "[T]hese sites are uniquely contributing to a blurring of boundaries between legitimate medical care and exploitative clinical practices." --&gt;

&lt;!-- &gt; The politics of evidence is not a question of quality, but 'who has the power to control the definition of evidence, who defines the kinds of materials that count as evidence, who determines what methods best produce the best form of evidence, whose criteria and standards are used to evaluate quality evidence.'" --&gt;

# Research questions
## The who and why of crowdfunding in Australia

???

- So within the literature, there has been investigations on the positives and mostly negatives of crowdfunding, and mostly looking in the United States

- But online crowdfunding is also not too uncommon in Australia, and our health care system is quite different to America.

- So we want to know... 

--

.bold[Who] is crowdfunding their health expenses in Australia? 
- What are the conditions?
- Age groups and other demographics?

--

.bold[Why] are they crowdfunding their health expenses in Australia? 
- System issues? (Medicare coverage, private health insurance, out-of-pocket costs)
- What are the costs? (treatments, travel, loss of income)

# Crowdfunding in Australia

- $89,000 / $100,000 goal 

&gt; "On the 17th of December our beautiful mum... was very unexpectedly diagnosed with a stage 4 Glioblastoma brain tumour. This tumour is extremely aggressive and because of a complication during her initial surgery surgeons are reluctant to perform another operation to completely remove the tumour. The average person survives roughly 12 months with this type of brain tumour.

&gt; We are not ready to say goodbye in 12 months and will fight this to the end. We are currently looking at alternative therapy and surgery but the cost is going to be astronomical and unfortunately mum doesn't have health insurance or income protection so this is where we need some help. We will need $100,000 for her therapy and surgeries."

&lt;!-- --- --&gt;
&lt;!-- # Crowdfunding in Australia --&gt;
&lt;!-- - $5,845 / $35,000 goal --&gt;

&lt;!-- &gt; "...But this week R had to go to hospital for urgent surgery because she was at risk of organ failure and issues were compounding. She was told to have surgery quickly, or risk taking decades off her life expectancy." --&gt;

&lt;!-- &gt; "So she took $30,000 out of her superannuation to pay for the surgery and is currently in recovery. But $30K in super now would be worth $200,000 when she retires from a lifetime of helping other people and the world." --&gt;

---
# Crowdfunding in Australia
- $65,645 / $60,000 goal

&gt; "J's cancer story starts in March, 2018 ... they had found a tumour in her colon."

&gt; "J is looking at all options of treatment including alternative therapies to complement western medicine and is currently pursuing diet, exercise, meditation, yoga, acupuncture and chinese medicine."

&gt; "The stress of dealing with the financial impact of cancer and trial treatments  (which are not covered by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme aka PBS) plus chemo medication &amp; all the daily living expenses is extremely challenging for J and her family. Immediately after her diagnosis J had to stop working and the cancer and it's side effects do not allow her to work at all."

&gt; "Our aim is to relieve this immense pressure on the family so the family can afford daily living costs and J can be free to try whatever treatment she needs to heal."

# Current stage

Discussions with researchers who have recently published on crowdfunding
- Berliner, L. S. and N. J. Kenworthy (2017). "Producing a worthy illness: Personal crowdfunding amidst financial crisis." Social Science &amp; Medicine 187: 233-242.

- Tanner, C., Munsie, M., et al. (2019). The politics of evidence in online illness narratives: An analysis of crowdfunding for purported stem cell treatments. Health. 

???

- Like I said earlier, this is at an early stage. 

- One nice thing about this being an 'emerging' research interest and problem is that people are really interested in discussing their ideas.

- Lauren Berliner from University of Washington Bothell - social scientist and internet research. Visiting Australia later this year, still really interested in this space.
- Claire &amp; Megan are from University of Melbourne, Centre for Stem Cell Systems. They've published a lot on stem cell treatments, medical tourism, and the issues around evidence... this was their first piece on crowdfunding (looked at global campaigns and not just Australian)


--

Planning research outline and methods

???

- We're looking at getting on overview or sample of GoFundMe pages, but this is complicated because they are organised according to what's currently 'trending'

- And for the data analysis it'll likely be a mixed methods approach to answer the two questions on the *who* and *why*

--

Draft proposal for ethics application

???

- Planning: feedback and getting involved in the project...?

- Ethics application: advice from the ethics office is to submit an application and request a waiver of consent. 

&lt;!-- --- --&gt;
&lt;!-- # Proposed methods --&gt;
&lt;!-- Data sample &amp; collection --&gt;
&lt;!-- -- --&gt;

&lt;!-- - 'Random' sample...? --&gt;

&lt;!-- - Extract trending campaigns from https://au.gofundme.com/discover/medical-fundraiser --&gt;

&lt;!-- - Check other popular websites --&gt;



&lt;!-- -- --&gt;

&lt;!-- Data analysis: mixed methods approach --&gt;

&lt;!-- - Descriptive statistics of patient demographics  --&gt;

&lt;!-- - Content analysis on the *why* of crowdfunding --&gt;

# Potential impact of project

--

System issues: 
- Crowdfunding (or other alternative funding sources) + public-private healthcare system = *more private patients??*
- Inequities in crowdfunding: *who deserves donations?* 

--

Out-of-pocket stress: 
- Potential data source and more information on out-of-pocket costs

--

Low-value or unproven treatments:
- If *appropriate* care funded by Medicare, what is GoFundMe funding?
