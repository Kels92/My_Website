title: "Ethical internet research"
event: "Sydney Health Ethics Conversation Series"
event_url:
location: "The University of Sydney"
summary:
abstract: "This presentation follows our attempt to review online Australian medical crowdfunding campaign pages to understand the ‘gaps’ these might tell us about our healthcare system, similar to recent US and Canadian studies. Our project received conditional approval from HREC in June provided we could show our methods were allowed by GoFundMe’s terms and conditions, and if not we would need a letter of approval from GoFundMe to undertake the research. This issue has arisen because of the recent changes to the NHMRC human research ethics statement, which can now means researchers and HRECs can’t assume that information posted online is in the ‘public domain’ and available for research."
